# davit-crane-dynamics-simulation
A simulation of lifting dynamics, stress distribution, and motion modelling of a davit crane using Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib) and MATLAB scripts.
# Davit Crane Dynamics Simulation

This repository models the basic physics of a davit crane used for lifting heavy loads.
The project is based on an actual engineering project completed at CPUT.

## What is modelled
- Lifting force calculation
- Normal stress on structural members
- Lifting velocity analysis

## Engineering focus
The goal is to apply mechanical engineering theory using code.
All formulas are based on classical mechanics and strength of materials.

## Tools used
- Python
- Engineering mathematics
